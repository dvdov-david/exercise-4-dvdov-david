# Exercise 4: Functions (10 points)

The exercise for this week is meant to help you to understand how to create and use functions in Python.
You will create a simple tool that converts temperatures from one kind of temperature scale to another and then classify those temperatures into specific temperature classes.

After making your changes to the notebook, you will need to upload it to GitHub.

- Don't forget to check out the [hints for this week's exercise](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L4/exercise-4.html#exercise-4-hints) if you're having trouble.
- **Exercise 4 is due by the start of the next lesson (9:15 am, 30 September 2020)**.
- **We are [working in pairs](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/why-pairs.html) on this exercise**, and we will only grade the repository of the member of your pair that is responsible for this week's exercise. 

## Before you start

### Clone the Exercise 4 repository

Before starting to work with the actual problems for this week, you should start a new JupyterLab instance and clone your own Exercise 4 repository (e.g., exercise-4-htenkanen) into the instance using Git as we saw in [**lesson 2**](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/git-basics.html#clone-a-repository-from-github).

## Start working

### Problem 0 - Mid-term course feedback requested

Before you get started on the exercise, we'd like for you to take 5 minutes to provide us with some feedback on how the course is going so far. We would be very pleased to have your honest thoughts (positive or negative) about how things are going. The feedback you provide is **completely anonymous**.

### Problems 1-3: Classifying and converting temperatures (10 points)

There are three problems in this week's exercise.

1. [Problem 1 - Simple temperature calculator (3 points)](Exercise-4-problem-1.ipynb)
2. [Problem 2 - Temperature classifier (3 points)](Exercise-4-problem-2.ipynb)
3. [Problem 3 - Applying the classifier (4 points)](Exercise-4-problem-3.ipynb)
